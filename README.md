<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://nascent-bot-cancer-app-myappwelcome-i66wjm.streamlitapp.com)

A **Convolutional Neural Network**, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of [neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks) that specializes in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. The benefits of deep learning in healthcare are plentiful – fast, efficient, accurate – but they don’t stop there. Even more benefits lie within the neural networks formed by multiple layers of `AI` and `ML` and their ability to learn. With the help of these great technologies, I have created a model that could **predict whether a person is malignant with Breast Cancer or not**.
> [Breast cancer](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3986-breast-cancer) is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells.  
 
Why Breast Cancer is dangerous:
* 1 in 8 women who live to be age 70 will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.
* Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in Ireland.
* In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer)
* In 2022, it is estimated that 43,250 women and 530
men will die of breast cancer. [ACS](https://www.cancer.org/)

But there is good news:
* Breast Cancer's mortality rate has been **declining since 1989**
* Women whose breast cancer is detected at an early stage have a **93 percent or higher survival rate**

Based on the experimental results, the proposed model achieved 90% accuracy

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Clone the Repo.
  ```sh 
git clone https://github.com/ACM40960/project-RaghulRavikumar.git
  ```
  

#### Installation

Below is the list of applications that are needed to be installed to view and execute this project locally.

Frameworks
1. Anaconda ([Steps to Install](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/installing-anaconda-windows)) ⚠️select python version above 3.5
2. Atom ([Steps to Install](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-atom-editor-with-all-the-required-packages/)) 

#### Packages  
Launch the terminal by following the below steps 
1. Execute Anaconda Navigator
2. Click on Environments
3. Create an Environment
4. Select created environment -> Open Terminal

Now you are good to install the required packages using console. Use the below commands to install them in your environment.

To Execute  the Model
```sh 
conda install numpy
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install pandas
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install matplotlib
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install seaborn
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install scikit-learn
  ```
  ```sh 
pip install pytest-shutil
  ```
  ```sh 
pip3 install opencv-python
  ```
  ```sh 
conda install tensorflow
```
To Render with UI
```sh
pip install streamlit
 ```
```sh
pip install pybase64
 ```
```sh
pip install datetime
  ```
  ```sh 
  pip install Pillow
  ```
  
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Execution
To Train The Model
1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook Note: Please Install if require
3. Upload "Second version.ipynb"
4. Press Shift+Enter to run cells one by one
More information about the model are given in the file

To View as Web Application
1. Launch Anaconda terminal as mentioned  <a href="#packages">here</a>
2. Navigate to the location were the project is cloned using cd command
3. Make sure `information.py` file is located and file structure is maintained
4. Now use below command to host the application locally
```sh 
  streamlit run information.py
  ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the webpage is launched click on the [Predict](http://localhost:8501/Predict) tab
* Step 1: Fill the User Information (Not Mandatory)
* Step 2: Upload The Image
	* Step 2.1: Browse File to upload the histopathology image
	* Step 2.2: You can also use sample image if you don't have any by selecting Use Sample Image
* Step 3: Click "Run On This Image"
* Step 4: Please Wait
> You can see the result for the uploaded image
